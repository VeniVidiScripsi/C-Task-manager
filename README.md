# C-Task-manager

Who doesn't like to manage their tasks in a textual interface in a black window from the 80s?
Just kidding, it's just my attempt to write code in the C language, implement algorithms and stuff.


## Command-Line Task Manager

A simple command-line based Task Manager implemented in C, allowing users to manage their tasks efficiently. The Task Manager provides functionalities such as adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, deleting tasks, and displaying a list of tasks.

## Features

1. **Task Addition:**
   - Allows users to add tasks with a title, description, and due date.
   - Stores tasks persistently to ensure they are not lost when the program is closed.

2. **Task List:**
   - Displays a list of all tasks with details (title, description, due date, status).
   - Tasks can be color-coded or categorized based on their due dates or priority.

3. **Task Completion:**
   - Allows users to mark tasks as completed.
   - Provides an option to undo task completion.

4. **Task Deletion:**
   - Allows users to delete tasks they no longer need

5. **Data Persistence:**
   - Stores tasks in a file to ensure data persistence between program runs.

## Additional Challenges (Optional)


It is currently very basic, and here is a list of optional improvements (If the force be with me):

1. **User Authentication:**
    - Implement a basic user authentication system to secure task data.

2. **Task Details Editing:**
    - Provide the ability to edit task details after they have been added.

3. **Task Priority Colors:**
    - Assign different colors to tasks based on their priority level.

4. **Multiple Task Lists:**
    - Allow users to create and manage multiple task lists (e.g., work tasks, personal tasks).

5. **Deadline Notifications:**
    - Integrate a notification system to remind users of approaching task deadlines.

6. **Data Encryption:**
    - Enhance data security by encrypting task data stored in the file.

7. **Undo/Redo Functionality:**
    - Implement undo and redo functionalities for task management operations.

8. **Data Import/Export:**
     - Allow users to import and export task data to and from external files in various formats.

9. **Task Dependencies:**
     - Introduce a system to define dependencies between tasks, indicating which tasks must be completed before others.

10. **Collaborative Editing:**
     - Extend the collaboration feature to enable real-time collaborative task management between multiple users.

11. **Task Archiving:**
     - Provide an option to archive completed tasks, keeping the main task list uncluttered.
